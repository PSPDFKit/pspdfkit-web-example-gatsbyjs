## Nutrient assets

In order to make the example work, the Nutrient assets need to be copied from their original location in `./node_modules/@nutrient-sdk/viewer/dist` to `./static`. This is done automatically from a postinstall script in located in `./scripts/copy-nutrient-files.js`.

In case copying the files fails, you can copy them manually:

- Copy `./node_modules/@nutrient-sdk/viewer/dist/nutrient-viewer.js` to `./static/nutrient-viewer.js`.
- Copy `./node_modules/@nutrient-sdk/viewer/dist/nutrient-viewer-lib/` to `./static/nutrient-viewer-lib/`.

That's it!
